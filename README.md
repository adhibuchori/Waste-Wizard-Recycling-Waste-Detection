## What is Waste Wizard?
Waste Wizard is a mobile application that utilizes machine learning technology, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms, to detect and identify types of recyclable waste. It aims to assist users in proper waste sorting by providing information about the waste generated.

## Why Choose Waste Wizard?
Performing offline classification of recyclable waste, including packaging waste such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal waste, with a prediction speed of approximately 1 second and a success rate of over 85% using the InceptionV3 CNN Architecture.

## Develop with Full of Love
By collecting 1000++ recyclable waste image data, developing a machine learning model with the selection of appropriate architecture to enhance prediction accuracy, and crafting and building an outstanding application.

## Background Summary
1. At the end of 2022, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry reported that the total national waste increased from 28.6 million tons to 34.4 million tons from the previous year.
2. Lack of awareness and knowledge among the public on how to properly sort waste.
3. Human limitations in recognizing various types of recyclable waste.

## Problem Statements
1. Development of Machine Learning Model  
   How to build a machine learning model to detect recyclable waste using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm?
2. Development of Android Mobile Application  
   How to integrate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to detect recyclable waste in an Android-based application?
